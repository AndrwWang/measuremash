# MeasureMash
The Empire State Building is about 1250 feet tall. An American football field is around 120 yards wide. But how tall is 1250 feet, *exactly*? How wide is 120 yards wide, *exactly*? Oftentimes we are made to know the dimensions of buildings and structures, but it's difficult to visualize them: that's where **MeasureMash** comes in.
